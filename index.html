    <h3> Does Frequency of Voting Change With Income and Education Levels?</h3>
    <p> According to the data, voting frequency, income, and education are clearly correlated. 
      Individuals who stated that they "always" voted were more likely to have a college degree and make 
      more than $75,000 per year. By contrast, people who said they "rarely/never" voted were more likely to 
      be low-income and have only completed high school. Voters who cast sporadic ballots displayed 
      a more balanced distribution of education and income levels. The figure shows significant evidence that people 
      with greater levels of education were more likely to fall into the highest salary category, while 
      people with lower levels of education tended fall into the opposite category. </p>

    <h3>How Did Voter Turnout and Absentee Voting Change in Virginia General Elections From 2014 to 2022? </h3>
    <p> The years 2016 and 2020 saw increased in-person voting turn outs when compared with the rest of the data.
         Particularly, 2020 saw dramatic growth in voter turnout. When comparing 2016 and 2020, the latter saw a 
         dramatic increase of absentee ballots as well. The year that may stand out the most to a keen eye is 2018. 
         This was not the highest voting year by any means (that would be 2020), but it featured some interesting details.
          Contained in that yearâ€™s data are multiple regions with over 100% voting turnouts. This presumably has to do 
          with the status of a voter being active or inactive as it pertains to whether the state thinks you have moved 
          away. Inactive voters who are still eligible to vote push the count over 100%. </p>

    <h3> What Did Voter Turnout Look Like in Cities and Counties in Virginia in the 2022 General Election?</h3>
    <p> Among the counties in Virginia, those in the general Northern regions tended to have higher voter turnout. 
        Highland, Madison, and Rappahannock are examples of counties with higher voter turnout in 2022. Likewise, 
        counties like Buchanan in the Southwest ranked lowest among voter turnout rates. </p>
