  <h3> Does Frequency of Voting Change With Income and Education Levels?</h3>
  <p> According to the data, voting frequency, income, and education are clearly correlated. 
    Individuals who stated that they "always" voted were more likely to have a college degree and make 
    more than $75,000 per year. By contrast, people who said they "rarely/never" voted were more likely to 
    be low-income and have only completed high school. Voters who cast sporadic ballots displayed 
    a more balanced distribution of education and income levels. The figure shows significant evidence that people 
    with greater levels of education were more likely to fall into the highest salary category, while 
    people with lower levels of education tended to make less money. </p>
